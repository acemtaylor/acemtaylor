Hi! I'm Ace :) 

I'm in my 30s and based in <span title="Melbourne">Naarm, Australia</span>. I'm disabled, nonbinary and use they/them pronouns.

I'm fairly new to all of this but am enjoying learning what I can. In saying that I've been <b>coding websites since 2005</b> and the days of Microsoft Frontpage. While I'm mostly self taught I have completed a <b>Graduate Certificate in Data Science Fundamentals</b> as of 2025.

<b>Comfortable using</b>
Python | HTML | CSS | MySQL | 

<b>Learning/Brushing Up on</b>
Javascript | PHP | Kotlin

<b>To Learn</b>
Node.js | Typescript | Vuejs | Cloudflare

When I'm not coding or building websites, I <b>work in admin</b> at a law firm, I <b>volunteer</b> both for the National Trust of Victoria and for the Australian Greens. I am also a <b>writer</b> and have published a short story. Ialso enjoy <b>gaming</b> but mostly just play phone games these days as I try and recover from burning out in 2023 and nearly burning out <i>again</i> in 2025.
